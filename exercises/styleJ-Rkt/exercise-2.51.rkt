;   Exercise 2.51
;   =============
;   
;   Define the below operation for painters.  Below takes two painters as
;   arguments.  The resulting painter, given a frame, draws with the first
;   painter in the bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the
;   top.  Define below in two different ways -- first by writing a procedure
;   that is analogous to the beside procedure given above, and again in
;   terms of beside and suitable rotation operations (from exercise [2.50]).
