;   Exercise 3.49
;   =============
;   
;   Give a scenario where the deadlock-avoidance mechanism described above
;   does not work.  (Hint: In the exchange problem, each process knows in
;   advance which accounts it will need to get access to.  Consider a
;   situation where a process must get access to some shared resources
;   before it can know which additional shared resources it will require.)
