;   Exercise 2.72
;   =============
;   
;   Consider the encoding procedure that you designed in exercise [2.68]. 
;   What is the order of growth in the number of steps needed to encode a
;   symbol?  Be sure to include the number of steps needed to search the
;   symbol list at each node encountered.  To answer this question in
;   general is difficult. Consider the special case where the relative
;   frequencies of the n symbols are as described in exercise [2.71], and
;   give the order of growth (as a function of n) of the number of steps
;   needed to encode the most frequent and least frequent symbols in the
;   alphabet.
