;   Exercise 4.54
;   =============
;   
;   If we had not realized that require could be implemented as an ordinary
;   procedure that uses amb, to be defined by the user as part of a
;   nondeterministic program, we would have had to implement it as a special
;   form.  This would require syntax procedures
;   
;   (define (require? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'require))
;   
;   (define (require-predicate exp) (cadr exp))
;   
;   and a new clause in the dispatch in analyze
;   
;   ((require? exp) (analyze-require exp))
;   
;   as well the procedure analyze-require that handles require expressions. 
;   Complete the following definition of analyze-require.
;   
;   (define (analyze-require exp)
;     (let ((pproc (analyze (require-predicate exp))))
;       (lambda (env succeed fail)
;         (pproc env
;                (lambda (pred-value fail2)
;                  (if <??>
;                      <??>
;                      (succeed 'ok fail2)))
;                fail))))
