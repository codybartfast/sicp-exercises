;   Exercise 4.39
;   =============
;   
;   Does the order of the restrictions in the multiple-dwelling procedure
;   affect the answer? Does it affect the time to find an answer?  If you
;   think it matters, demonstrate a faster program obtained from the given
;   one by reordering the restrictions.  If you think it does not matter,
;   argue your case.
