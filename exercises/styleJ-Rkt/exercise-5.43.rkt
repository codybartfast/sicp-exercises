;   Exercise 5.43
;   =============
;   
;   We argued in section [4.1.6] that internal definitions for block
;   structure should not be considered "real" defines.  Rather, a procedure
;   body should be interpreted as if the internal variables being defined
;   were installed as ordinary lambda variables initialized to their correct
;   values using set!.  Section [4.1.6] and exercise [4.16] showed how to
;   modify the metacircular interpreter to accomplish this by scanning out
;   internal definitions.  Modify the compiler to perform the same
;   transformation before it compiles a procedure body.
