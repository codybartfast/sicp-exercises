;   Exercise 3.10
;   =============
;   
;   In the make-withdraw procedure, the local variable balance is created as
;   a parameter of make-withdraw.  We could also create the local state
;   variable explicitly, using let, as follows:
;   
;   (define (make-withdraw initial-amount)
;     (let ((balance initial-amount))
;       (lambda (amount)
;         (if (>= balance amount)
;             (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
;                    balance)
;             "Insufficient funds"))))
;   
;   Recall from section [1.3.2] that let is simply syntactic sugar for a
;   procedure call:
;   
;   (let ((<var> <exp>)) <body>)
;   
;   is interpreted as an alternate syntax for
;   
;   ((lambda (<var>) <body>) <exp>)
;   
;   Use the environment model to analyze this alternate version of
;   make-withdraw, drawing figures like the ones above to illustrate the
;   interactions
;   
;   (define W1 (make-withdraw 100))
;   
;   (W1 50)
;   
;   (define W2 (make-withdraw 100))
;   
;   Show that the two versions of make-withdraw create objects with the same
;   behavior.  How do the environment structures differ for the two
;   versions?
