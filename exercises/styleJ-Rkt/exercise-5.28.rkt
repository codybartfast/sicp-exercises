;   Exercise 5.28
;   =============
;   
;   Modify the definition of the evaluator by changing eval-sequence as
;   described in section [5.4.2] so that the evaluator is no longer
;   tail-recursive.  Rerun your experiments from exercises [5.26] and [5.27]
;   to demonstrate that both versions of the factorial procedure now require
;   space that grows linearly with their input.
