;   Exercise 1.24
;   =============
;   
;   Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of exercise [1.22] to use
;   fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you
;   found in that exercise.  Since the Fermat test has Î¸(log n) growth, how
;   would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with
;   the time needed to test primes near 1000?  Do your data bear this out? 
;   Can you explain any discrepancy you find?
