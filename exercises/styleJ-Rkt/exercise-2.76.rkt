;   Exercise 2.76
;   =============
;   
;   As a large system with generic operations evolves, new types of data
;   objects or new operations may be needed.  For each of the three
;   strategies -- generic operations with explicit dispatch, data-directed
;   style, and message-passing-style -- describe the changes that must be
;   made to a system in order to add new types or new operations.  Which
;   organization would be most appropriate for a system in which new types
;   must often be added?  Which would be most appropriate for a system in
;   which new operations must often be added?
