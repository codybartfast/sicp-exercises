;   Exercise 3.31
;   =============
;   
;   The internal procedure accept-action-procedure! defined in make-wire
;   specifies that when a new action procedure is added to a wire, the
;   procedure is immediately run.  Explain why this initialization is
;   necessary.  In particular, trace through the half-adder example in the
;   paragraphs above and say how the system's response would differ if we
;   had defined accept-action-procedure! as
;   
;   (define (accept-action-procedure! proc)
;     (set! action-procedures (cons proc action-procedures)))
