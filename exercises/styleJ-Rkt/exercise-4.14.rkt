;   Exercise 4.14
;   =============
;   
;   Eva Lu Ator and Louis Reasoner are each experimenting with the
;   metacircular evaluator.  Eva types in the definition of map, and runs
;   some test programs that use it.  They work fine.  Louis, in contrast,
;   has installed the system version of map as a primitive for the
;   metacircular evaluator.  When he tries it, things go terribly wrong. 
;   Explain why Louis's map fails even though Eva's works.
