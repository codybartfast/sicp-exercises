;   Exercise 4.17
;   =============
;   
;   Draw diagrams of the environment in effect when evaluating the
;   expression <e3> in the procedure in the text, comparing how this will be
;   structured when definitions are interpreted sequentially with how it
;   will be structured if definitions are scanned out as described. Why is
;   there an extra frame in the transformed program?  Explain why this
;   difference in environment structure can never make a difference in the
;   behavior of a correct program.  Design a way to make the interpreter
;   implement the "simultaneous" scope rule for internal definitions without
;   constructing the extra frame.
