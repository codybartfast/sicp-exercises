;   Exercise 4.78
;   =============
;   
;   Redesign the query language as a nondeterministic program to be
;   implemented using the evaluator of section [4.3], rather than as a
;   stream process.  In this approach, each query will produce a single
;   answer (rather than the stream of all answers) and the user can type
;   try-again to see more answers.  You should find that much of the
;   mechanism we built in this section is subsumed by nondeterministic
;   search and backtracking.  You will probably also find, however, that
;   your new query language has subtle differences in behavior from the one
;   implemented here.  Can you find examples that illustrate this
;   difference?
