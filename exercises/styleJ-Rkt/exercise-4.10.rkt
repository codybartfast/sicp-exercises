;   Exercise 4.10
;   =============
;   
;   By using data abstraction, we were able to write an eval procedure that
;   is independent of the particular syntax of the language to be evaluated.
;   To illustrate this, design and implement a new syntax for Scheme by
;   modifying the procedures in this section, without changing eval or
;   apply.
