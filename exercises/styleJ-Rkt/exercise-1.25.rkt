;   Exercise 1.25
;   =============
;   
;   Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in
;   writing expmod.  After all, she says, since we already know how to
;   compute exponentials, we could have simply written
;   
;   (define (expmod base exp m)
;     (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
;   
;   Is she correct?  Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime
;   tester?  Explain.
