;   Exercise 5.13
;   =============
;   
;   Modify the simulator so that it uses the controller sequence to
;   determine what registers the machine has rather than requiring a list of
;   registers as an argument to make-machine.  Instead of pre-allocating the
;   registers in make-machine, you can allocate them one at a time when they
;   are first seen during assembly of the instructions.
