;   Exercise 4.9
;   ============
;   
;   Many languages support a variety of iteration constructs, such as do,
;   for, while, and until.  In Scheme, iterative processes can be expressed
;   in terms of ordinary procedure calls, so special iteration constructs
;   provide no essential gain in computational power.  On the other hand,
;   such constructs are often convenient.  Design some iteration constructs,
;   give examples of their use, and show how to implement them as derived
;   expressions.
