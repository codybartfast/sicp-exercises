;   Exercise 5.18
;   =============
;   
;   Modify the make-register procedure of section [5.2.1] so that registers
;   can be traced. Registers should accept messages that turn tracing on and
;   off.  When a register is traced, assigning a value to the register
;   should print the name of the register, the old contents of the register,
;   and the new contents being assigned.  Extend the interface to the
;   machine model to permit you to turn tracing on and off for designated
;   machine registers.
