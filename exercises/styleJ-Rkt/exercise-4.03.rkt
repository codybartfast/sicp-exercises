;   Exercise 4.3
;   ============
;   
;   Rewrite eval so that the dispatch is done in data-directed style. 
;   Compare this with the data-directed differentiation procedure of
;   exercise [2.73]. (You may use the car of a compound expression as the
;   type of the expression, as is appropriate for the syntax implemented in
;   this section.) .
