;   Exercise 4.36
;   =============
;   
;   Exercise [3.69] discussed how to generate the stream of all Pythagorean
;   triples, with no upper bound on the size of the integers to be searched.
;   Explain why simply replacing an-integer-between by
;   an-integer-starting-from in the procedure in exercise [4.35] is not an
;   adequate way to generate arbitrary Pythagorean triples.  Write a
;   procedure that actually will accomplish this.  (That is, write a
;   procedure for which repeatedly typing try-again would in principle
;   eventually generate all Pythagorean triples.)
