;   Exercise 4.7
;   ============
;   
;   Let* is similar to let, except that the bindings of the let variables
;   are performed sequentially from left to right, and each binding is made
;   in an environment in which all of the preceding bindings are visible. 
;   For example
;   
;   (let* ((x 3)
;          (y (+ x 2))
;          (z (+ x y 5)))
;     (* x z))
;   
;   returns 39.  Explain how a let* expression can be rewritten as a set of
;   nested let expressions, and write a procedure let*->nested-lets that
;   performs this transformation.  If we have already implemented let
;   (exercise [4.6]) and we want to extend the evaluator to handle let*, is
;   it sufficient to add a clause to eval whose action is
;   
;   (eval (let*->nested-lets exp) env)
;   
;   or must we explicitly expand let* in terms of non-derived expressions?
