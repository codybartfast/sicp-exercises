;   Exercise 4.63
;   =============
;   
;   The following data base (see Genesis 4) traces the genealogy of the
;   descendants of Ada back to Adam, by way of Cain:
;   
;   (son Adam Cain)
;   (son Cain Enoch)
;   (son Enoch Irad)
;   (son Irad Mehujael)
;   (son Mehujael Methushael)
;   (son Methushael Lamech)
;   (wife Lamech Ada)
;   (son Ada Jabal)
;   (son Ada Jubal)
;   
;   Formulate rules such as "If S is the son of F, and F is the son of G,
;   then S is the grandson of G" and "If W is the wife of M, and S is the
;   son of W, then S is the son of M" (which was supposedly more true in
;   biblical times than today) that will enable the query system to find the
;   grandson of Cain; the sons of Lamech; the grandsons of Methushael. (See
;   exercise [4.69] for some rules to deduce more complicated
;   relationships.)
