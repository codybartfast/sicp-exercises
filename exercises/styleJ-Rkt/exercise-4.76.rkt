;   Exercise 4.76
;   =============
;   
;   Our implementation of and as a series combination of queries (figure
;   [4.5]) is elegant, but it is inefficient because in processing the
;   second query of the and we must scan the data base for each frame
;   produced by the first query.  If the data base has N elements, and a
;   typical query produces a number of output frames proportional to N (say
;   N/k), then scanning the data base for each frame produced by the first
;   query will require N²/k calls to the pattern matcher.  Another approach
;   would be to process the two clauses of the and separately, then look for
;   all pairs of output frames that are compatible.  If each query produces
;   N/k output frames, then this means that we must perform N²/k²
;   compatibility checks -- a factor of k fewer than the number of matches
;   required in our current method.
;   
;   Devise an implementation of and that uses this strategy.  You must
;   implement a procedure that takes two frames as inputs, checks whether
;   the bindings in the frames are compatible, and, if so, produces a frame
;   that merges the two sets of bindings.  This operation is similar to
;   unification.
