;   Exercise 1.38
;   =============
;   
;   In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir De
;   Fractionibus Continuis, which included a continued fraction expansion
;   for e - 2, where e is the base of the natural logarithms. In this
;   fraction, the Nᵢ are all 1, and the Dᵢ are successively 1, 2, 1, 1, 4,
;   1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, ....  Write a program that uses your cont-frac
;   procedure from exercise [1.37] to approximate e, based on Euler's
;   expansion.
