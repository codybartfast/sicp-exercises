;   Exercise 4.49
;   =============
;   
;   Alyssa P. Hacker is more interested in generating interesting sentences
;   than in parsing them.  She reasons that by simply changing the procedure
;   parse-word so that it ignores the "input sentence" and instead always
;   succeeds and generates an appropriate word, we can use the programs we
;   had built for parsing to do generation instead.  Implement Alyssa's
;   idea, and show the first half-dozen or so sentences generated.⁽⁵⁴⁾
