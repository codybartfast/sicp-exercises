;   Exercise 4.42
;   =============
;   
;   Solve the following "Liars" puzzle (from Phillips 1934): 
;   
;       Five schoolgirls sat for an examination.  Their parents -- so
;       they thought -- showed an undue degree of interest in the
;       result.  They therefore agreed that, in writing home about the
;       examination, each girl should make one true statement and one
;       untrue one.  The following are the relevant passages from their
;       letters:
;   
;       * Betty: "Kitty was second in the examination.  I was only
;       third."
;   
;       * Ethel: "You'll be glad to hear that I was on top.  Joan was
;       second."
;   
;       * Joan: "I was third, and poor old Ethel was bottom."
;   
;       * Kitty: "I came out second.  Mary was only fourth."
;   
;       * Mary: "I was fourth.  Top place was taken by Betty."
;   
;       What in fact the order in which the five girls were placed?
