;   Exercise 4.1
;   ============
;   
;   Notice that we cannot tell whether the metacircular evaluator evaluates
;   operands from left to right or from right to left.  Its evaluation order
;   is inherited from the underlying Lisp: If the arguments to cons in
;   list-of-values are evaluated from left to right, then list-of-values
;   will evaluate operands from left to right; and if the arguments to cons
;   are evaluated from right to left, then list-of-values will evaluate
;   operands from right to left.
;   
;   Write a version of list-of-values that evaluates operands from left to
;   right regardless of the order of evaluation in the underlying Lisp. 
;   Also write a version of list-of-values that evaluates operands from
;   right to left.
