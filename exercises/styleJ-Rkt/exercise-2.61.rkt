;   Exercise 2.61
;   =============
;   
;   Give an implementation of adjoin-set using the ordered representation. 
;   By analogy with element-of-set? show how to take advantage of the
;   ordering to produce a procedure that requires on the average about half
;   as many steps as with the unordered representation.
