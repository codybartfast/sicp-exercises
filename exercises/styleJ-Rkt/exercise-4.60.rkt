;   Exercise 4.60
;   =============
;   
;   By giving the query
;   
;   (lives-near ?person (Hacker Alyssa P))
;   
;   Alyssa P. Hacker is able to find people who live near her, with whom she
;   can ride to work.  On the other hand, when she tries to find all pairs
;   of people who live near each other by querying
;   
;   (lives-near ?person-1 ?person-2)
;   
;   she notices that each pair of people who live near each other is listed
;   twice; for example,
;   
;   (lives-near (Hacker Alyssa P) (Fect Cy D))
;   (lives-near (Fect Cy D) (Hacker Alyssa P))
;   
;   Why does this happen? Is there a way to find a list of people who live
;   near each other, in which each pair appears only once?  Explain.
