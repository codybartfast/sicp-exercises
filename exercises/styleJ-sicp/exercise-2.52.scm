;   Exercise 2.52
;   =============
;   
;   Make changes to the square limit of wave shown in figure [2.9] by
;   working at each of the levels described above.  In particular:
;   
;   a.  Add some segments to the primitive wave painter of exercise [2.49]
;   (to add a smile, for example).
;   
;   b.  Change the pattern constructed by corner-split (for example, by
;   using only one copy of the up-split and right-split images instead of
;   two).
;   
;   c.  Modify the version of square-limit that uses square-of-four so as to
;   assemble the corners in a different pattern.  (For example, you might
;   make the big Mr. Rogers look outward from each corner of the square.)
