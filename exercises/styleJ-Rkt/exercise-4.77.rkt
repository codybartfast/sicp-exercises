;   Exercise 4.77
;   =============
;   
;   In section [4.4.3] we saw that not and lisp-value can cause the query
;   language to give "wrong" answers if these filtering operations are
;   applied to frames in which variables are unbound.  Devise a way to fix
;   this shortcoming.  One idea is to perform the filtering in a "delayed"
;   manner by appending to the frame a "promise" to filter that is fulfilled
;   only when enough variables have been bound to make the operation
;   possible.  We could wait to perform filtering until all other operations
;   have been performed.  However, for efficiency's sake, we would like to
;   perform filtering as soon as possible so as to cut down on the number of
;   intermediate frames generated.
